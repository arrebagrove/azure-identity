# Azure Identity
#### Azure Active Directory B2C
Azure Active Directory B2C allows developers to authenticate users with a single identity management solution that supports both social providers (Facebook, Google, Amazon, LinkedIn) as well as local accounts (username/password or email/password combinations). As developers, we can focus on building great cross-platform mobile apps without having to worry about the pains that come with identity management (scalability, sign in, sign up, password reset, 2FA, etc.), while still building a flexible solution that works for all of our users, whether they prefer authenticating with local accounts or social providers.
